      <h1>Coronavirus Work From Home Model</h1>
      <p>This model should help you and your company make a decision on whether you should open your office or send everybody home.</p>
      <p>Itâ€˜s based on how many cases are probably in your area, and the likelihood that at least one of your employees catches it.</p>
      <p>It has lots of assumptions, but all the data is here so you can play with the assumptions to adapt them to your situation.</p>
      <p>You only need to make changes to the first tab; the rest are data inputs that you can change too.</p>
      <p>Please leave comments to improve it.</p>
